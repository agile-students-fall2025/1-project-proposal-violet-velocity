## Project Title
**Stashly – A Mobile Web App for Simple Student Budgeting**


## What and Why?
This semester, we propose to build **Stashly**, a mobile budgeting web application designed specifically for students and young adults.  

The problem: Many students struggle to manage their limited finances. Existing budgeting apps are either too complicated or too basic. As a result:
- Students often overspend on food, entertainment, or impulse purchases.  
- They lack clear visibility into where their money is going.  
- Financial stress builds up, adding to the pressure of academic life.  

**Why this is important:** Helping students gain simple control over their day-to-day finances can reduce stress, promote financial clarity, and encourage long-term healthy finacial habits.  

## For Whom?
The target users are college students, people who face tight budgets, live with part-time incomes or allowances, and often lack experience with financial tools.  

This app is designed for:
- Students living on campus who want to track spending on food, activities, and transportation.  
- Young adults balancing limited incomes with personal expenses.  
- Peers in our own networks (friends, classmates, roommates) who already express frustration with money management tools being too complex.  

By focusing on people just like us, we’ll be able to gather real feedback and refine Stashly for genuine use cases.  

## How?
Stashly will:  
- Allow quick logging of expenses into categories (Food, Fun, Transportation, etc.).
- Show a dashboard with visual summaries of how much of their budget has been used.  
- Offer goal tracking (e.g., saving for spring break, a laptop, etc.).  

The focus is on keeping the interface clean, approachable, and friendly, no intimidating charts or overcomplicated wording.  

## Scope
This project is scoped appropriately for a team of 4–6 programmers over one semester:  
- The app has a clear, well-defined set of features (budget dashboard, logging, and goals).  
- It is neither too simple, because it requires  data persistence, mobile design, and UI/UX, nor unmanageable, we are not building a full bank-linked finance platform.  
- The project will challenge us to think about design, usability, and user experience, while still being achievable within the semester timeline.  

By the end of the semester, we expect to deliver a functional, mobile-friendly budgeting tool that our peers can realistically use in their daily lives.
